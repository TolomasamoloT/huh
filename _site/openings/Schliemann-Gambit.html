<p>The Schliemann (AKA Jaenisch) Gambit is one of Black’s most aggressive responses to the time-tested Ruy Lopez. Some say the Schliemann is unsound, but GM Melikset Khachiyan (Melik) believes the Schliemann is better than its reputation.In this series, Melik provides you with all of the essential theory, concepts, and examples you need to master this opening and take the fight to White!</p>

<p>I think the Jaenisch/Schliemann Gambit (C63 - 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5!?) is a very interesting system! This anti-Lopez line was first played and explored by the Finnish player Carl Jaenisch around 1847. However, the German player Adolf Schliemann adopted it later and, for some reason, many people named it after him!</p>
