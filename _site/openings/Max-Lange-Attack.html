<p>The Max Lange Attack is a dangerous attacking weapon for players who wish to avoid the theory of the Fried Liver Attack (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc5 Nf6 4.Ng5) against the Two Knights Defense. Chess players who choose the Two Knights Defense are much more likely to know how to play against the Fried Liver Attack than the Max Lange Attack.</p>
