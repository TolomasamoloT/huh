<p>The Napoleon Opening is named after the French general and emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who had a deep love of chess but was said to be a mediocre player. [1] The name came into use after mid-nineteenth century publications reported [2] that he played this opening in an 1809 game [3] that he lost to The Turk, a fake chess automaton operated at the time by Johann Allgaier.</p>

<p>The Napoleon is a weak opening because it develops the white queen prematurely and subjects it to attack, and deprives the white kingside knight of its best development square. The Napoleon Opening is named after the French general and emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, who had a deep love of chess but was said to be a mediocre player.</p>
